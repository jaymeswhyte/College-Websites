# College-Websites
Websites made during web development module in my degree. Unfortunately I have no means to host these at the moment.

Both of these sites make use of flask.
In "News" you will find a mock-up news site using an SQL database to manage articles, users etc. This project was focused on server-side programming.
"Game" contains a simple javascript game featuring a saved high-score system.
